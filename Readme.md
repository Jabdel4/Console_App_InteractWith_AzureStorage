# Simple Azure Project

This project helps me to undersand how to create a console application with .NET 8 and Azure Files.

It realizes some actions like:
+ Create a File Share
+ Get the contents of a file.
+ Set the maximum size, or quota, for a file share.
+ Create a shared access signature (SAS) for a file.
+ Copy a file to another file in the same storage account.
+ Copy a file to a blob in the same storage account.
+ Create a snapshot of a file share.
+ Restore a file from a share snapshot.

For this project, I provide some useful links to help anybody to have a solid understanding of how to create and interact with Azure File Share programmatically.
